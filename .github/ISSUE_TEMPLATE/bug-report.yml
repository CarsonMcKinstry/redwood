        We're trying it out because we want...

        > 1. issues to be more structured, (specifically, bug reports)

        > 2. to be more upfront about our process—i.e., what happens after you open an issue (see the paragraph below)

        >

        > We want the process of opening an issue to be smooth for you as a contributor,
        so please do let us know what you think [over on the forums](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/what-do-you-think-of-the-new-github-issue-forms/3463).


        Thanks for taking the time to open an issue!
        Here's a bit of background on what you can expect about the process:

        - Expect a response from us (the core team) within three to seven days.
          - Usually we'll respond sooner than that, but sometimes we have a lot on our plate. Thanks for your patience!

        > **But what if this is critical?**

        >

        > We're aware of issues as soon as they're opened,
        but just don't always respond straightaway.
        Too much task switching is a productivity killer.
        So don't worry, we're pretty good about escalating critical issues.
        But if you think we're taking too long,
        feel free to ping us (after you open this) on the thread here on GitHub
        or DM one of us on the [forums](https://community.redwoodjs.com/g/Core-Team) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/redwoodjs)

        - After you open this, the Redwood bot will assign a core team member to it. They'll triage it.
          - If they don't within three to seven days, the Redwood bot will ping them. You should feel free to ping them too!

        Describe the bug here.
        The more detail you provide, the better,
        but try to start with a summary to frame the issue.
        See the placeholder below for an example.

        The dev server doesn't seem to be working.
        When I run `yarn rw dev`,
        the web side doesn't start and throws `TypeError: cli.isMultipleCompiler is not a function`.
        I was just following the tutorial when I ran into this,
        so nothing fancy going on here.


        I think this probably has to do with [webpack-cli](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli).
        I skimmed the issues on their repo and it looks like they just released a new version.
        If we bump the version Redwood is using, it may resolve this.

        What commands do we need to run?
        What packages do we need to install?
        What does the `schema.prisma` need to look like?
        Again, the more detail, the better!


        Have a repo on GitHub with the reproduction? Amazing—include the link here.


        Can't provide a reproduction?
        We understand that you can't always provide one,
        but it'll be much harder for us to debug without one.
        Any information is invaluable.

        1. create a new redwood app
        2. start the dev server

        ```shell
        yarn create redwood-app redwood-app
        # ...
        cd redwood-app
        yarn rw dev
        # ...

        We just want to invite you to contribute to Redwood.
        If you choose to contribute, the core team will be there to help you the whole way.


        In some cases, if this issue is triaged as being lower priority,
        your willing- and ableness to work on this will land it faster than waiting for a core team member to pick it up.
        But if this is critical, it'll of course be escalated.
